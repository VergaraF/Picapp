 This app is a social network based on pictures, and ratings. 
 Any user can upload a picture and it'll be stored on a server. Users will get a picture randomly from the DB (making user the user hasn't seen it yet) and it will be displayed on his feed. The user will be able to browse through every picture, randomly, and rate them from 1 to 5!. Users have their own account, and it has an account manager fully impletemented (create users with their respective passwords/info, hashing & salting their passwords. login/logout, and pattern verification for emais and passwords).

 For this app backend, it is implemented using PHP and MySQL for its database. The mobile app was developed in Eclipse IDE using Java (back in the day when Android Studio wasn't just there yet).
